#MeowMix Plus
MeowMix plus is a World of Warcraft addon written in 2006 for playing as the druid class. It extends Kneeki's MeowMix addon however it is no longer functional due to changes made to the scripting engine by Blizzard.

I don't play anymore so it is no longer supported, but feel free to use it in your own addons if it helps at all.

## Installation
To install the addon simply copy the MeowMixPlus folder and everything in the dependencies directory into the addons directory within your World of Warcraft game folder.
