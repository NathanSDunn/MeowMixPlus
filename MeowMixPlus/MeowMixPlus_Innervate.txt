*  Invalid Targets
*  NPC's
*  Non Casters
*  Players that are already Innervated
*  Players with a higher than specified % of mana

-Usage
Use "/script MeowMixPlus_Innervate(percentage without %, channelName, booleanSendTell)" in for
example a macro. 

The MeowMixPlus_Innervate() function will return a value depending on what action it took:
0 = No innvervate was cast
1 = Innervate was cast on target
This allows you to make more advanced and correct macros using the MeowMixPlus_Innervate() function.
