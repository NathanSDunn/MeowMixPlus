This is the source for MeowMix Plus - Druid functions building on top of Kneeki's MeowMix for World of Warcraft.

It's horrendously out of date as I haven't played since 2006 and in no way supported.
I'm putting it up on github in case anyone would like to see some .lua examples of the old WoW scripting language

It probably doesn't work any more as Blizzard nerfed scripting shortly before I quit in 2006 :(
